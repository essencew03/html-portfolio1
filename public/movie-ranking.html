<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time </h2>

<hr />

<h3>The Blackening</h3>

<p>SO FUNNY even for a supposed horror.</p>

<h3>Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle</h3>

<p>The Rock Johnshon and Kevin Hart are a great combo in this movie.The acting is in so good.
    Especially when they body switch. 
</p>

<p>
    THIS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
